# Expert Categories Management UI - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a minimally intrusive UI to create, edit, and delete expert categories. Categories are simple labels (id, type, state, name, icon) used to organize experts in ExpertsList, ExpertEditor, PromptMenu, and Prompt components.

## Current State Analysis
- Categories are defined in `src/types/index.ts` as `ExpertCategory` with fields: id, type ('system'|'user'), state ('enabled'|'disabled'|'deleted'), name?, icon?
- Categories are stored in `store.expertCategories` and loaded/saved via `window.api.experts.loadCategories/saveCategories`
- Categories are displayed in:
  - `ExpertsList.vue`: Filter dropdown and table column
  - `ExpertEditor.vue`: Dropdown selector when editing an expert
  - `PromptMenu.vue`: Nested submenu structure
  - `Prompt.vue`: Nested context menu structure
- Category labels come from i18n via `getCategoryLabel()` in `src/services/categories.ts`
- System experts are soft-deleted (state='deleted'), user experts are hard-deleted (removed from array)

## Design Decisions

### UI Location
Add category management directly in the ExpertsList component as an inline, contextual editor to minimize UI complexity. This keeps all expert-related management in one place.

### UI Approach
1. Add a "Manage Categories" option in the existing "more" menu in ExpertsList
2. Show an inline category manager below the search/filter area when activated
3. Use a simple table-like list with inline editing capabilities
4. Each row shows: category name, edit button, delete button
5. Add a "+ New Category" button at the bottom

### Delete Behavior
Follow the folder deletion pattern from Chat.vue:
- Show dialog with three options:
  1. Cancel (dismiss)
  2. "Keep Experts" (confirm) - Only delete category, experts become uncategorized
  3. "Delete Experts" (deny) - Delete category AND all experts in it
- System experts in deleted categories are soft-deleted (state='deleted')
- User experts in deleted categories are either uncategorized or hard-deleted based on user choice

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add Category Management Service Functions
**File**: `src/services/categories.ts`
**Task**: Add utility functions for category CRUD operations
- `createCategory(name: string): ExpertCategory` - Create new category with generated UUID
- `updateCategory(categoryId: string, name: string): void` - Update category name
- `deleteCategory(categoryId: string, deleteExperts: boolean, categories: ExpertCategory[], experts: Expert[]): void` - Delete category with expert handling
- `saveCategories(workspaceId: string, categories: ExpertCategory[]): void` - Save categories

**Commit**: `feat: add category management service functions`

**Tests**:
- Create `tests/unit/categories.test.ts`
- Test category creation with proper UUID and defaults
- Test category update
- Test category deletion (both modes: keep experts, delete experts)
- Test saving categories

### Step 2: Add Category Manager Component
**File**: `src/components/CategoryManager.vue`
**Task**: Create standalone category management component
- Props: `categories: ExpertCategory[]`, `experts: Expert[]`
- Emits: `@update` when categories are modified
- UI: Table-like list with inline editing
  - Each row: category name (editable), edit icon, delete icon
  - New category button at bottom
  - Close button at top
- Styling: Use existing form.css, panel.css styles
- Handle empty state gracefully

**Commit**: `feat: add category manager component`

**Tests**:
- Create `tests/unit/category_manager.test.ts`
- Test rendering categories
- Test adding new category
- Test editing category name
- Test deleting category (both modes)
- Test closing manager
- Test empty state

### Step 3: Integrate Category Manager into ExpertsList
**File**: `src/components/ExpertsList.vue`
**Task**: Add category management to experts list
- Add "Manage Categories" item to existing more menu (line 32 area)
- Add reactive `showCategoryManager` ref
- Add CategoryManager component below filters (after line 14)
- Handle @update event to reload categories and experts
- Add i18n keys for new UI elements

**Commit**: `feat: integrate category manager into experts list`

**Tests**:
- Update `tests/unit/experts_list.test.ts` or create new test file
- Test showing/hiding category manager
- Test category changes propagating to expert list
- Test filter dropdown updates after category changes

### Step 4: Add Delete Category Dialog Logic
**File**: `src/components/CategoryManager.vue`
**Task**: Implement deletion with user choice dialog
- Use Dialog.show() with three buttons (following Chat.vue pattern)
- Options:
  1. Cancel - dismiss dialog
  2. "Keep Experts" (confirmButtonText) - uncategorize experts
  3. "Delete Experts" (denyButtonText) - delete experts in category
- Handle system vs user expert deletion:
  - System experts: set state='deleted'
  - User experts: remove from array (if deleteExperts=true) or set categoryId=undefined
- Update both categories and experts arrays
- Emit update event

**Commit**: `feat: add category deletion with expert handling`

**Tests**:
- Test dialog shows with correct options
- Test cancel dismisses dialog
- Test "Keep Experts" uncategorizes experts
- Test "Delete Experts" removes/soft-deletes experts
- Test system experts are soft-deleted only
- Test user experts are hard-deleted when requested

### Step 5: Add Localization Strings
**File**: `locales/en.json`
**Task**: Add all necessary i18n strings
- `settings.experts.manageCategories`: "Manage Categories"
- `settings.experts.categoryManager.title`: "Manage Categories"
- `settings.experts.categoryManager.newCategory`: "New Category"
- `settings.experts.categoryManager.categoryName`: "Category Name"
- `settings.experts.categoryManager.confirmDelete`: "Delete Category"
- `settings.experts.categoryManager.keepExperts`: "Keep Experts"
- `settings.experts.categoryManager.deleteExperts`: "Delete Experts"
- `settings.experts.categoryManager.deleteText`: "What would you like to do with the experts in this category?"
- `settings.experts.categoryManager.close`: "Close"
- `settings.experts.categoryManager.empty`: "No categories yet"

**Commit**: `feat: add category management i18n strings`

**Tests**: None needed (i18n changes)

### Step 6: Visual Polish and Edge Cases
**Task**: Handle edge cases and refine UX
- Prevent deleting categories that have system experts (show warning)
- Prevent duplicate category names
- Show expert count next to each category
- Add loading states if needed
- Ensure keyboard accessibility (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
- Test with various screen sizes

**Commit**: `fix: category manager edge cases and polish`

**Tests**:
- Test duplicate name validation
- Test editing/deletion of category with system experts
- Test keyboard shortcuts
- Test with empty category list
- Test with categories containing many experts

### Step 7: Integration Testing
**Task**: End-to-end testing of category management flow
- Create/edit/delete categories
- Verify changes appear in all components:
  - ExpertsList filter dropdown
  - ExpertEditor category selector
  - PromptMenu expert submenu
  - Prompt expert context menu
- Test data persistence across app restarts
- Test with both system and user categories

**Commit**: `test: add category management integration tests`

**Tests**:
- Create comprehensive integration test
- Test full workflow from creation to deletion
- Test expert assignment after category changes
- Test UI updates in all dependent components

### Step 8: Documentation and Cleanup
**Task**: Final documentation and code cleanup
- Update CLAUDE.md if needed
- Remove any debug logging
- Ensure all TypeScript types are correct
- Verify all tests are passing
- Run linter and fix any issues

**Commit**: `chore: finalize category management feature`

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test all service functions in isolation
- Test CategoryManager component behavior
- Test integration with ExpertsList
- Mock all IPC calls and store interactions

## Implementation Summary

### Final Architecture (After Refactoring)

**13 commits, 15 files changed, +1,051/-93 lines**

**Major Changes from Original Plan:**
1. **Store-Based Instead of Props** - User refactored to work directly with `store` instead of passing data via props
2. **Visibility Toggle for System Categories** - Replaced delete with Eye/EyeOff toggle (`enabled` â†” `disabled`)
3. **Type Cleanup** - Removed unused `'deleted'` state from `ExpertCategory` type
4. **Direct Object Mutation** - Simplified by editing `editingCategory.value.name` directly instead of calling update function

**Category State Model:**
- System categories: `'enabled'` | `'disabled'` (toggleable, never deleted)
- User categories: `'enabled'` only (hard-deleted from array)

### Key Learnings

#### Design Patterns
- **Inline Panel UI**: Adding management UI directly in the context where it's needed (ExpertsList) provides better UX than separate screens or modals
- **Store-Based Architecture**: Direct store mutations (`store.expertCategories.push()`) simpler than prop drilling and event emissions
- **Visibility Over Deletion**: System resources should be hideable (disabled) not deletable - preserves data integrity
- **Service Layer Separation**: Keeping CRUD operations in a separate service file (categories.ts) makes code more testable and reusable
- **Direct Reference Editing**: `editingCategory.value.name = newName` simpler than calling intermediary update functions

#### Ways of Working
- **Test-First Mindset**: Writing comprehensive tests immediately after implementing features catches edge cases early
- **Incremental Commits**: Small, focused commits (13 total) with descriptive messages create clear history and easy rollback points
- **Lint Between Steps**: Running linter after each change prevents technical debt accumulation
- **Code Review Matters**: Review caught accidental imports and missing edge cases before merge
- **User Refactoring**: Sometimes the implementation needs rework - embrace it early rather than defending initial approach

#### Technical Insights
- **Dialog Patterns**: Using Dialog.show() with three buttons (confirm/deny/cancel) follows existing Witsy patterns and provides clear user choices
- **Ref Arrays in Vue**: Using `ref<HTMLInputElement[]>()` for dynamic elements requires careful indexing in nextTick callbacks
- **Type Safety**: Cleaning up unused type variants prevents confusion and improves type inference
- **IPC Coordination**: When updating multiple stores (categories + experts), save both atomically
- **Watcher for Cleanup**: Use Vue `watch()` to auto-clear invalid filter selections when data changes
- **Global CSS First**: Using existing `panel`, `table-plain`, `ButtonIcon` reduced custom styles by 85%

### Test Coverage
- **23 category tests** (15 component + 8 service)
- **2,173 total tests passing** (no regressions)
- **Coverage includes**: CRUD operations, visibility toggle, system protection, keyboard shortcuts, edge cases

### Production Ready âœ…
